## Smart Contract (Clarity)

The core of EscrowLock is implemented as a Clarity smart contract on the Stacks blockchain. The contract handles:

- Escrow creation and management
- Funds locking and release
- Multi-signature approval process

## Backend (Python)

The Python backend provides an API for interacting with the smart contract and manages off-chain data. It includes:

- RESTful API for client interactions
- Database management for transaction records
- Integration with the Stacks blockchain

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Deploy the smart contract to the Stacks blockchain
4. Configure the backend with your Stacks account details
5. Run the backend: `python backend/app.py`

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```
python -m unittest discover tests
```
